# Group worker handoff

Read `/home/xinra/qcp-binary-democases/.agents/skills/group-worker-proving/SKILL.md` and its required workflow documents completely. Use this assignment without relying on a parent transcript or current sibling output.

- Group: `constant_safety_a`; difficulty hint: 1/5.
- Copied manual: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/verification_runs/SemaphoreDelete-20261030135715/SemaphoreDelete-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_08__constant_safety_a/SemaphoreDelete_proof_manual.v`.
- Editable proof spans: `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_1`, `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_2`, `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_3`, `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_4`.
- Protected LLM split blocks (keep generated Proof/Abort tokens): none.
- Statements, declaration order, prelude and all unassigned proof tokens remain fixed. Formatting is ignored.
- Group library: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/verification_runs/SemaphoreDelete-20261030135715/SemaphoreDelete-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_08__constant_safety_a/SemaphoreDelete_lib.v`
- Read-only canonical library: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/VC/SemaphoreDelete_lib.v`
- Every new/adapted helper uses suffix `__constant_safety_a`. Preserve the seed.

The current accepted predicate sources listed in `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/checks/implement-frozen-inputs.json`
and their formal dependencies are read-only semantic inputs. Read their definitions
and existing lemmas as needed; do not edit them. Historical proofs are references only; check contract and dependency compatibility before reuse.

### `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_1` — `LLM_pre_process`

Use LLM_pre_process; both goals are the constant 0 within signed Int bounds. Unfold INT_MIN/INT_MAX if needed and solve arithmetic; all spatial resources are irrelevant frames and need no unfolding.
### `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_2` — `LLM_pre_process`

Use LLM_pre_process; both goals are the constant 0 within signed Int bounds. Unfold INT_MIN/INT_MAX if needed and solve arithmetic; all spatial resources are irrelevant frames and need no unfolding.
### `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_3` — `LLM_pre_process`

Use LLM_pre_process; both goals are the constant 0 within signed Int bounds. Unfold INT_MIN/INT_MAX if needed and solve arithmetic; all spatial resources are irrelevant frames and need no unfolding.
### `proof_of__SemaphoreDelete_safety_wit_4` — `LLM_pre_process`

Use LLM_pre_process; both goals are the constant 0 within signed Int bounds. Unfold INT_MIN/INT_MAX if needed and solve arithmetic; all spatial resources are irrelevant frames and need no unfolding.

## Helpers

- None planned.

## Historical references

- Previous proving round: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/verification_runs/SemaphoreDelete-20261030135715/SemaphoreDelete-vc-proving-r1`.
- Annotation history: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/verification_runs/SemaphoreDelete-20261030135715/annotation_history`; earlier canonical proofs may be in an attempt's `before` directory.
- Optional human reuse note: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphoredelete-trial-261025-1/reports/SemaphoreDelete-20261030135715/rounds/SemaphoreDelete-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_08__constant_safety_a/proof_reuse.md`.

Search relevant historical blocks when useful. The controller does not search, copy, or rename historical proofs. Decide whether to adapt them and recheck against current inputs.

## Commands

Use these exact argv/cwd objects. Shell-only tools may quote each argument for the actual shell; PowerShell uses `&` with single-quoted arguments and doubled embedded apostrophes. Follow the skill for proof modes, safety, and checks.

Continue each live tool session until its actual exit. Successful checks require both exit zero and JSON status passed.
