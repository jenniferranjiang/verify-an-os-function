# Group worker handoff

Read `/home/xinra/qcp-binary-democases/.agents/skills/group-worker-proving/SKILL.md` and its required workflow documents completely. Use this assignment without relying on a parent transcript or current sibling output.

- Group: `manager_open`; difficulty hint: 4/5.
- Copied manual: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/InsertObj-20261012130948/InsertObj-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_00__manager_open/InsertObj_proof_manual.v`.
- Editable proof spans: `proof_of_InsertObj_entail_wit_1`, `proof_of_InsertObj_entail_wit_2`.
- Protected LLM split blocks (keep generated Proof/Abort tokens): none.
- Statements, declaration order, prelude and all unassigned proof tokens remain fixed. Formatting is ignored.
No case library exists: do not create helpers, imports, or a library.

The current accepted predicate sources listed in `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/evidence/predicate-manifest.json`
and their formal dependencies are read-only semantic inputs. Read their definitions
and existing lemmas as needed; do not edit them. Never access historical CRTOS trials.

### `proof_of_InsertObj_entail_wit_1` — `LLM_pre_process`

Pattern H (agent_output.md). Unfold the whole disjunction and choose its second alternative. Open store_idmanager_allocated_unlinked and store_sem_id_detached under OSHeap: preserve four manager cells, allocated bitmap, old buckets, node id and exact prev/next cells. Extract min-free/idbuckets_ok and detached p/link nonzero; choose x_2=next and x=previous. Bounds 0<=id<=65535 and hoffset<=65535 follow from owned UShort cells (or bitmap idmax bounds plus min-free); positive hoffset comes from idbuckets_ok. Transport the exact cells through OSHeap, reorder/cancel all resources. No state transition, no new helper.
### `proof_of_InsertObj_entail_wit_2` — `LLM_pre_process`

Patterns H/B. Frame all manager, bitmap and detached-node cells. Set index=id mod hoffset(sm), prove 0<=index<Zlength(idbuckets before) from hoffset>0 and idbuckets_ok length. Lift store_idbuckets_split, obtaining selected bucket=Znth index old_buckets nil and store_idbuckets_except. Lift store_idbucket_cases; eliminate its spatial disjunction, choosing the corresponding target spatial alternative separately. For BSS use bucket=nil and head<>0 with exact zero cells; for initialized case instantiate the extracted hn,hp,bucket and retain idnodes_nonzero and idnodes_dllseg. Both branches obtain head<>0 from the accepted representation, never from address arithmetic or field ownership. Keep link<>0 and all existing pure facts.

## Helpers

- None planned.

## Historical references

- Previous proving round: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/InsertObj-20261012130948/InsertObj-vc-proving-r1`.
- Annotation history: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/InsertObj-20261012130948/annotation_history`; earlier canonical proofs may be in an attempt's `before` directory.
- Optional human reuse note: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/reports/InsertObj-20261012130948/rounds/InsertObj-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_00__manager_open/proof_reuse.md`.

Search relevant historical blocks when useful. The controller does not search, copy, or rename historical proofs. Decide whether to adapt them and recheck against current inputs.

## Commands

Use these exact argv/cwd objects. Shell-only tools may quote each argument for the actual shell; PowerShell uses `&` with single-quoted arguments and doubled embedded apostrophes. Follow the skill for proof modes, safety, and checks.

Continue each live tool session until its actual exit. Successful checks require both exit zero and JSON status passed.
