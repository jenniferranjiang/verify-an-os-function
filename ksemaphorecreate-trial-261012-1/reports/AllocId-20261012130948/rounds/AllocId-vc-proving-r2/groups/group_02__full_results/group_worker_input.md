# Group worker handoff

Read `/home/xinra/qcp-binary-democases/.agents/skills/group-worker-proving/SKILL.md` and its required workflow documents completely. Use this assignment without relying on a parent transcript or current sibling output.

- Group: `full_results`; difficulty hint: 4/5.
- Copied manual: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/AllocId-20261012130948/AllocId-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_02__full_results/AllocId_proof_manual.v`.
- Editable proof spans: `proof_of_AllocId_return_wit_2`, `proof_of_AllocId_return_wit_3`.
- Protected LLM split blocks (keep generated Proof/Abort tokens): none.
- Statements, declaration order, prelude and all unassigned proof tokens remain fixed. Formatting is ignored.
No case library exists: do not create helpers, imports, or a library.

The current accepted predicate sources listed in `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/evidence/predicate-manifest.json`
and their formal dependencies are read-only semantic inputs. Read their definitions
and existing lemmas as needed; do not edit them. Never access historical CRTOS trials.

### `proof_of_AllocId_return_wit_2` — `LLM_pre_process`

Choose the failure disjunct with returned -1. Establish idmanager_full by taking any 0 <= j < idmax and rewriting its query with id_map_bytes_ok_query_eq. Repack store_idmanager using the existing bytes as the existential witness and existing idbuckets_ok. Rewrite quot to div from idmax >= 0, and combine identical fields/array/bucket resources through OSHeap heap-lift definitions and crtos_heap_lift_sep; no heap update. Here idmax <= id. If j/8 < index use the index prefix and Ztestbit_255_low; otherwise prove j/8=index and j mod 8 < offset from j<id and the entry invariant, so its scanned bit is true. The byte <> 255 guard rules out offset=8, using byte_eq_255_of_low_bits.
### `proof_of_AllocId_return_wit_3` — `LLM_pre_process`

Choose the failure disjunct with returned -1. Establish idmanager_full by taking any 0 <= j < idmax and rewriting its query with id_map_bytes_ok_query_eq. Repack store_idmanager using the existing bytes as the existential witness and existing idbuckets_ok. Rewrite quot to div from idmax >= 0, and combine identical fields/array/bucket resources through OSHeap heap-lift definitions and crtos_heap_lift_sep; no heap update. Here index=end; id_div8_lt_quot_ceil8 gives j/8<index. The index-scan invariant makes that byte 255, and Ztestbit_255_low gives the desired bit.

## Helpers

- None planned.

## Historical references

- Previous proving round: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/AllocId-20261012130948/AllocId-vc-proving-r1`.
- Annotation history: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/verification_runs/AllocId-20261012130948/annotation_history`; earlier canonical proofs may be in an attempt's `before` directory.
- Optional human reuse note: `/home/xinra/crtos/ksemaphorecreate-trial-261012-1/reports/AllocId-20261012130948/rounds/AllocId-vc-proving-r2/groups/group_02__full_results/proof_reuse.md`.

Search relevant historical blocks when useful. The controller does not search, copy, or rename historical proofs. Decide whether to adapt them and recheck against current inputs.

## Commands

Use these exact argv/cwd objects. Shell-only tools may quote each argument for the actual shell; PowerShell uses `&` with single-quoted arguments and doubled embedded apostrophes. Follow the skill for proof modes, safety, and checks.

Continue each live tool session until its actual exit. Successful checks require both exit zero and JSON status passed.
