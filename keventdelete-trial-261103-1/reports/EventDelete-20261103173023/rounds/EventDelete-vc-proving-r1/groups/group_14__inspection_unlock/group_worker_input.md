# Group worker handoff

Read `/home/xinra/qcp-binary-democases/.agents/skills/group-worker-proving/SKILL.md` and its required workflow documents completely. Use this assignment without relying on a parent transcript or current sibling output.

- Group: `inspection_unlock`; difficulty hint: 1/5.
- Copied manual: `/home/xinra/crtos/keventdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/EventDelete-20261103173023/EventDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_14__inspection_unlock/EventDelete_proof_manual.v`.
- Editable proof spans: `proof_of__EventDelete_partial_solve_wit_6_pure`, `proof_of__EventDelete_partial_solve_wit_6`, `proof_of__EventDelete_partial_solve_wit_7_pure`, `proof_of__EventDelete_partial_solve_wit_7`.
- Protected LLM split blocks (keep generated Proof/Abort tokens): none.
- Statements, declaration order, prelude and all unassigned proof tokens remain fixed. Formatting is ignored.
- Group library: `/home/xinra/crtos/keventdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/EventDelete-20261103173023/EventDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_14__inspection_unlock/EventDelete_lib.v`
- Read-only canonical library: `/home/xinra/crtos/keventdelete-trial-261103-1/VC/EventDelete_lib.v`
- Every new/adapted helper uses suffix `__inspection_unlock`. Preserve the seed.

### `proof_of__EventDelete_partial_solve_wit_6_pure` — `LLM_pre_process`

P/Q contain precisely old os_inv checked and InsideCritical checked; Q wants their order swapped plus existing Crtos_GTrans checked checked and inspection facts. Pure goals project GTrans; implication wrappers cancel shared atoms and restate facts. The concrete waiting is not promised stable after unlock. Exact obligation: partial_solve_wit_6_pure.

## Helpers

- None planned.

## Historical references

- Previous proving round: `none`.
- Annotation history: `/home/xinra/crtos/keventdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/EventDelete-20261103173023/annotation_history`; earlier canonical proofs may be in an attempt's `before` directory.
- Optional human reuse note: `/home/xinra/crtos/keventdelete-trial-261103-1/reports/EventDelete-20261103173023/rounds/EventDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_14__inspection_unlock/proof_reuse.md`.

Search relevant historical blocks when useful. The controller does not search, copy, or rename historical proofs. Decide whether to adapt them and recheck against current inputs.

## Commands

Use these exact argv/cwd objects. Shell-only tools may quote each argument for the actual shell; PowerShell uses `&` with single-quoted arguments and doubled embedded apostrophes. Follow the skill for proof modes, safety, and checks.

Continue each live tool session until its actual exit. Successful checks require both exit zero and JSON status passed.

Use the skill's exact completed/blocked report contract. Stop writing before main finalizes. The group directory contains only its copied manual and, when provided, group library. Finalization validates the current files.
