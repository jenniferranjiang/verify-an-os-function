# Group worker handoff

Read `/home/xinra/qcp-binary-democases/.agents/skills/group-worker-proving/SKILL.md` and its required workflow documents completely. Use this assignment without relying on a parent transcript or current sibling output.

- Group: `found_result_frame`; difficulty hint: 1/5.
- Copied manual: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_07__found_result_frame/KMutexDelete_proof_manual.v`.
- Editable proof spans: `proof_of_KMutexDelete_partial_solve_wit_9_pure`, `proof_of_KMutexDelete_partial_solve_wit_9`, `proof_of_KMutexDelete_return_wit_4`.
- Protected LLM split blocks (keep generated Proof/Abort tokens): none.
- Statements, declaration order, prelude and all unassigned proof tokens remain fixed. Formatting is ignored.
- Group library: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_07__found_result_frame/KMutexDelete_lib.v`
- Read-only canonical library: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/VC/KMutexDelete_lib.v`
- Every new/adapted helper uses suffix `__found_result_frame`. Preserve the seed.

### `proof_of_KMutexDelete_partial_solve_wit_9_pure` — `LLM_pre_process`

The only consequent is retval=field_addr(original.mutex_addr,Mutex,id), already a pure premise. Introduce parameters and facts and lift that equality into the pure assertion; spatial current locals/frame do not supply a missing address.
### `proof_of_KMutexDelete_partial_solve_wit_9` — `LLM_pre_process`

Introduce pureVC; all auxiliary pure conjuncts are already premises. Preserve os_inv and InsideCritical exactly; no field reading or container conversion happens in this logical transport.
### `proof_of_KMutexDelete_return_wit_4` — `LLM_pre_process`

Instantiate the postcondition state with after_2. Its safeExec ret tt X is PreH1 and the antecedent is exactly OutsideCritical sg after_2; existential introduction plus cancellation closes the result. Do not use stale st_lock or before as the result state.

## Helpers

- None planned.

## Historical references

- Previous proving round: `none`.
- Annotation history: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/annotation_history`; earlier canonical proofs may be in an attempt's `before` directory.
- Optional human reuse note: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/reports/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/rounds/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_07__found_result_frame/proof_reuse.md`.

Search relevant historical blocks when useful. The controller does not search, copy, or rename historical proofs. Decide whether to adapt them and recheck against current inputs.

## Commands

Use these exact argv/cwd objects. Shell-only tools may quote each argument for the actual shell; PowerShell uses `&` with single-quoted arguments and doubled embedded apostrophes. Follow the skill for proof modes, safety, and checks.

Debug script: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/verification_runs/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/_coq_builds/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/group_07/src/.coq_debug/group_07_found_result_frame.v`. Continue each live tool session until its actual exit. Successful checks require both exit zero and JSON status passed.

## Delivery

- Notes: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/reports/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/rounds/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_07__found_result_frame/group_worker_output.md`; annotation-gap requires a nonempty explanation.
- Terminal report: `/home/xinra/crtos/kmutexdelete-trial-261103-1/reports/KMutexDelete-20261103170333/rounds/KMutexDelete-vc-proving-r1/groups/group_07__found_result_frame/group_worker_report.json`.

Use the skill's exact completed/blocked report contract. Stop writing before main finalizes. The group directory contains only its copied manual and, when provided, group library. Finalization validates the current files.
